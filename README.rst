No Longer Supported
===================

NOTE: This repo is basically useless now, as GoDaddy requires 50+ domains to
access their API. I am moving to Cloudflare for my DNS needs.

GoDaddyUpdater
==============

Python tool used to update existing GoDaddy A-record DNS entries to current external IP address.

Source located @ https://github.com/wesparish/GoDaddyUpdater

This concept was spawned from observerss' and eXamadeus' GoDaddy libraries they have written.

Note: Check on Dockerhub for a containerized deployment that is driven by env vars.

Setup
--------

First, go to https://developer.godaddy.com/keys/ and request a production API key and secret.

*Note: Sometimes the production API keys don't seem to work correctly.  Just delete it and request another one.*

Second, install GoDaddyPy with pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install godaddypy
..

Third, clone this repo and execute the tool.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/wesparish/GoDaddyUpdater
..

Building
